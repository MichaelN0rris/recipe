This is a recipe for carnitas. The measurements are mere suggestions, it is reccommended to measure from the heart. 
Ingredients:

- 3-6 large onions

A Mexican friend shared this recipe with me saying that they got it from their abuela. 
The most important thing is for the end product to taste like pork, which is why there is not much else on the ingredients list. 
Instructions:
1. Remove the pork form the bone and cut the meat into 1 inch pieces removing excess fat and skin. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Slice your onions. 
3. Render some of the fat cut off of the sholder in a large heavy bottomed pot.
4. In batches brown the pork in the fat. 
5. Add all pork and onions back to the pot. cook until onions begin to soften.
6. Fill the pot with water to just come to the top of the pork and onions. 
7. Bring the water to a boil and reduce the heat to simmer. 
8. Cook down for several hours until the pork becomes tender and water boils off. 
9. Once cooked down the pork is ready to be served
10. Optionally you can fry up the meat in rendered fat or use a broiler to make crispy and extra delicious.
