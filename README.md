# Gringo Carnitas
Years ago I got this recipe second hand from my Mexican friend who's abuela gave it to them. The idea of this dish is to make the pork the star. So many recipes call for citrus or other ingredients to be added but my friend's abuela said the beauty of this dish is the simplicity. I make this all the time to have in tacos and will often make a big batch to freeze some for later. I hope that others reading this recipe will enjoy it as much as I have. line 2 changed remotely
